## ⚙️ How It Works (Simplified)

Scripts like this are written in Lua and injected into the Roblox client using exploit tools. Once executed, the script hooks into in-game events and automates various actions like targeting, collecting, or movement.

The “No Key” aspect means there are no annoying redirects, advertisements, or Discord verification steps—users gain immediate access after injection.
